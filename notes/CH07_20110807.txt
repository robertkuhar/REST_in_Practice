Chapter 7:  The Atom Syndication Format

HTML remains the most popular hypermedia format in use today.

Atom is an XML-based hypermedia format for representing timestamped lists of web content and metadata.

Atom provides a flexible, extensible, interoperable format for transferring data between applications.

Wide cross-platform support.

Atom represents data as lists, called Feeds.

Feeds are made up of one or more timestamped entries which associate metadata with web content.
  Feed metadata allows us to provide friendly descriptions of content, links to other services or resources, means of navigation to other feeds.

Atom doesn't attach any significance to the order of entries in a feed. 

<atom:content> element
 - Each entry also contains an <atom:content> element.
 - <atom:content> elements can contain arbitrary foreign elements, including elements that share the default namespace.
 - Here, the content includes a piece of Restbucks XML representing an order's details.  The <atom:content> element's type attribute contains a media type value (application/vnd. restbucks+xml) so that the consumers of an entry know how to process the payload.

Common uses for Atoms
  - Syndication:  A producer or publisher distributes content to many consumers via a common format
  - Representing documents and document-like structures
  - Creating metadata-rich lists of resources
  - Adding metadata to existing resource representations
  - Creating directories of nonhypermedia content
    Links to resources that cannot otherwise be represented in hypermedia format, such as binary objects
